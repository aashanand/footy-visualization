A Shiny App built on the engsoccerdata R package

Maintenance To-Do:
1. Re-deploy with new data when jalapic releases updated versions of the engsoccerdata R package.
2. Refactor league selector if jalapic releases new tables with the engsoccerdata R package.
3. Refactor initial dataset loading if there exists a way to load datasets directly into named list without creating copies.
4. Radio button needs to remember selection for England

Post to StackOverflow:
1. how to use assign() to dispatch assignment methods
2. shiny: ui.R possibly crashes when named list is large
3. shiny: reactive expressions vs. global functions
